I grew up in a house full of books, with artists for parents. I studied Sculpture at Camberwell College, then spent 5 years working in a second hand bookshop.

I make sculptural assemblages from found objects as well as collaborating with Mark James on photography and short films about long walks. We tend to focus our walks/films on 'edgelands' and wasteground.

I run the small open air gallery The London Arts Board, and, as my day job I am Marketing Manager at Mall Galleries.
