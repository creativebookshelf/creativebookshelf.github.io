Perhaps a bit specialist this one, but I think the themes and thoughts apply to art in general and not just Art Walking.

Phil Smith muses on the direction on current Walking Art and Psychogeography and the need for art to respond to the Socio-Political.

I found this incredibly inspiring stuff and made me consider the political and social implications and messages of my own work and want to make them much more of a central and driving element to how and why I make work.
