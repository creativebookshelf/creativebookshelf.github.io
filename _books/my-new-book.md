By Barbara Comyns

The image of a flooded grand house with the drowned peacocks from 'the grounds' floating past is enough for me to love this book.

Similar to the dead jewel encrusted tortoise of Against Nature; decadently tragic but also somehow quiet and domestic. Also, the whole story is based around a fungus.

I've made this book sound awful. It is beautfully moving, funny and sad. Utterly convincing.

I'm ashamed to say that this is one of the first books I read, well into my 20s, that made me realise that not all women authors wrote books that were either Bridget Jones' Diary or Wuthering Heights.

I now scan second hand bookshop shelves for the green spines of Virago Press, in the hope that they will be even half as good as Who Was Changed and Who Was Dead.
