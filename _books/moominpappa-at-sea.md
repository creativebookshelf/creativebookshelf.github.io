A children's book about a mid-life crisis, impotence, isolation, loneliess and frustration.

The father of the family becomes a lighthouse keeper on a tiny island in order to make himself indespensible to his family and seafarers. However, he can't get the lamp to light.

Exquisitely beautiful and sad. And Tove Jansson's illustrations are wonderous.
